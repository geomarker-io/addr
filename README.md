Addresses that were not validated at the time of collection are often
heterogenously formatted, making them difficult to directly compare. The
goal of addr is to clean, parse, standardize, and match messy,
real-world addresses in R to use for data linkages.

## Installation

Install the latest stable release of addr from
[R-universe](https://r-universe.dev) with:

``` r
install.packages("addr", repos = c("https://geomarker-io.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

Or, install the development version of addr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("cole-brokamp/addr")
```

Installing addr from GitHub requires a working
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) toolchain; install
one using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
